BDM, AMET
October 2018 - Present<br/>

In a small company, everyone wears more than one hat. At AMET, I'm the website manager, the only person dealing with Data & Analytics, the sole person responsible for strategy, project manager on Google adwords, project manager on our SaaS app that has gone to market, and project manager on our Salesforce integration.



I was brought in to develop the business, and that's exactly what has happened. In my time, AMET revenue has grown 7X. That looks like 50%, 25%, 20%, and 30% YoY growth in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 respectively. Google adwords ROI hovers around 1200%, our app has a roadmap for long term success, and our Saleforce offers ease of use in house and to our customers.

TM, SWISHER INTERNATIONAL
May 2016 - May 2017<br/>

With 1,200 accounts under my umbrella, I quickly made my mark, despite being the youngest on my team in terms of age and seniority. By having face to face interactions with local business owners, I grew product investment, increased SKU diversity, and optimized placement.

​

By the time I left, I was the number one TM on my team of 6, and in the top 15% for all of the western portion of the company.

BDM, BALANCE CXI
August 2015 - May 2016<br/>

Working for the start-up that acquired my start-up, my new focus was product development. Working with teams all over the world, I helped strengthen a product used by Comcast, AARP, and Bright House Networks.

​

My focus at Balance CX was aligning users with their customers by understanding CX, CSAT, and CRES. This took constant calibration between stakeholders, users, clients, third parties, and internal departments.

CIO, XAIROS CORP.
December 2014 - August 2015<br/>

Started in college, I helped develop an app that helps people meet. I was in charge of road mapping CX, building screens, and sifting through features. After months of working, my company was selected for the TechCrunch pitch off.



After presenting, my company caught the eye of another Austin based start-up.
